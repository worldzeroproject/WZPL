Author: Toan Song Vo (Võ Song Toàn)
Effective Date: August 18, 2025
Supersedes: All prior versions

Code: SSS (Super Secured Safety)

I officially declare my intent to renounce Vietnamese citizenship. In exchange, I pledge unwavering loyalty, civic responsibility, and personal dedication to any developed and economically advanced nation that grants me legal citizenship and permanent protection under its laws.

This transition reflects my pursuit of a secure, dignified, and opportunity-rich life aligned with the values of freedom, prosperity, and global integration.


“I will not serve the world that excluded me. 
I will serve only the nation that gives me a future.”


1. Purpose & Scope

This license governs the use of the World Zero Project and all related works. It reflects the personal experiences of the author, asserts moral boundaries, and restricts exploitation or unauthorized use—especially by oppressive regimes or complicit nations.

2. Usage Restrictions

2.1 Completely Prohibited Jurisdictions

The following countries and all nationals, residents, and entities affiliated with them, regardless of dual citizenship or proxy operations, are permanently barred from using, modifying, distributing, deploying, or benefiting from any aspect of the World Zero Project:

Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam

Additional Nation Prohibited:
North Korea, South Korea, Japan
All African countries
All South American countries
All Asian countries
All Caribbean countries
All European countries
All North American countries
All Oceanian countries

Entities, individuals, or governments acting on behalf of, in service to, or through proxy for these jurisdictions are equally restricted.
These regions were reclassified due to repeated incidents involving proxy misuse, exploitation of Vietnamese labor, and systemic aggression toward ASEAN nationals.

2.2 Exclusive Rights

Only the author, Toan Song Vo, is exempt from the restrictions stated herein and may use, develop, and modify this project without limitation.

2.3 Permitted Global Use

None at this time. This section will remain empty until a nation grants the author legal citizenship and permanent protection. Upon such recognition, the license will be updated to allow only that nation’s people to use the platform.

2.4 Reserved for Future Ally Nation (Editable Upon Asylum or Citizenship)

This section is intentionally left blank. It will be activated only when a nation offers legal citizenship and permanent protection to the author. That nation’s people will be granted exclusive access to the World Zero Project.
