For 13 years, I have fought for fairness, security, and acknowledgment, yet my concerns have been ignored. This license is a symbol of my independence, ensuring my work remains untouched by the injustices I have endured.  

Through the **World Zero Project (WZP)**, I aim to build technology that embodies **transparency and integrity**.

## üõ† About World Zero Project  
**World Zero Project** is more than just a technology initiative‚Äîit is a **statement of freedom**. Through it, I will prove that ethical principles and transparency can prevail.
