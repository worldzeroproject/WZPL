## 🧭 Vision

The **World Zero Project** is a foundational platform for logic execution, mission orchestration, and declarative UI integration. It is built to empower systems that think in steps, act with purpose, and honor the creator's boundaries and lived experiences.

> “It speaks the language of order, emotion, and structure—from logic to interface.”

This repository now reflects the final state of the project, sealed under WZPL v2.0.0. It is no longer open for external contribution. All changes are intentional, personal, and protected.

## 🚀 What It Offers

- **ZScript Engine** – A process-centric language for deterministic operations  
- **ZUI (ZUserInterface)** – Declarative .NET UI modeling with dynamic Razor bridge  
- **WZPL Licensing Model** – Purposeful access control rooted in geopolitical and ethical safety  
- **WZPL Syntax (optional)** – A higher-order script layer for expressive mission-building *(conceptual only)*
