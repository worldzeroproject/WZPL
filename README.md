# 🌍 World Zero Project License (WZPL)  
### Version 1.0 — Effective Date: August 2, 2025  

**Author:** _Toan Song Vo (Võ Song Toàn)_  

## 📌 Introduction  
The World Zero Project License (WZPL) is more than just a legal framework—it is a declaration of my experiences, my stand against corruption, and my commitment to ethical technology.

For 13 years, I have fought for fairness, security, and acknowledgment, yet my concerns have been ignored. This license is a symbol of my independence, ensuring my work remains untouched by the injustices I have endured.

Through the World Zero Project (WZP), I aim to build technology that embodies transparency and integrity. This license guarantees that my projects remain globally accessible while prohibiting access within Vietnam as a response to the corruption and negligence I have faced.

## 🚀 Purpose & Scope  
The WZPL governs all projects developed under the World Zero Project, protecting their integrity and defining strict usage terms. It is designed to:

- **Establish ownership** over the project and its principles.  
- **Ensure ethical usage** by restricting access to certain entities.  
- **Define clear rules** for individuals and organizations worldwide.  

## ❌ Usage Restrictions  
- **Authorized Users:** Individuals, organizations, and entities **outside Vietnam** are permitted to use, modify, and distribute this project.  
- **Prohibited Users:** No individual, organization, or government entity **within Vietnam** may access, use, modify, or distribute this project in any form.  
- **Enforcement:** As the author, I retain the right to revoke usage or take action if these terms are violated.  

## 🔄 Future Conditions  
Should justice be restored to me in Vietnam, I may **review and update** the license terms accordingly.  

## ⚠️ Liability Disclaimer  
The author is **not responsible** for any misuse, damages, or consequences arising from the use of the project. Users accept **all risks** associated with its implementation.  

## 🛠 About World Zero Project  
**World Zero Project** is more than just a technology initiative—it is a **statement of freedom**. Through it, I will prove that ethical principles and transparency can prevail.

My goal is to complete its development, release a **beta version**, and seek sponsorship to support my future beyond Vietnam.
