## 🧭 Vision

The **World Zero Project** is a foundational platform for logic execution, mission orchestration, and declarative UI integration. It is built to empower systems that think in steps, act with purpose, and honor the creator's boundaries and lived experiences.

> “It speaks the language of order, emotion, and structure—from logic to interface.”

- **ZUI (ZUserInterface)** – Declarative .NET UI modeling with dynamic Razor bridge
- **WZPL Licensing Model** – Purposeful access control rooted in geopolitical and ethical safety
- **WZPL Syntax (optional)** – Coming soon: A higher-order script layer for expressive mission-building
